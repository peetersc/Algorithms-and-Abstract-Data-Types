Abstract: 
	* The Matrix ADT is a calculator for performing matrix operations that 
	* exploits the (expected) sparseness of itâ€™s matrix operands that is
	* capable of performing fast matrix operations, even on very large  
	* matrices, provided they are sparse.

Files:
	   Sparse.java: 
		- Is the file that takes an in and out file to utilize the Matrix ADT

           Matrix.java:
		- Contains the Matrix ADT to store the NNZ elements of a sparse nxn matrix

           List.java:
		- Is used to hold a list of objects used as entries in the Matrix ADT

           MatrixTest.java:
		- Testing and debugging of the Matrix ADT 

           ListTest.java:
		- Testing and debugging of the List ADT

           Makefile:
		- Compiles, cleans, and makes executable files

           README:
		- Contains all the descriptions of all files in pa3
